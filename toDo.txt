- which bus route has the most stops?
- which bus stop is on the most bus routes?

visual ideas:
- make a chi map, with clickable pop-up info about the route, d3 bubbles at each point and lines for each stop
- or each point is just the stop, and make the d3 bubbles change color according to what you choose ( most boardings, most alightings, )
- have selection where you can show different routes, with the default being all routes
- on hover, will show stop name and the routes passing thru that stop

- for now, will show all routes
- if time, build out node api call to get a specific route
